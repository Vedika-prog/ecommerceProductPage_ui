# 💄 Lipstick Recommendation – E-commerce Product Page (Mobile UI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a mobile e-commerce product page designed as the purchase confirmation step of a lipstick recommendation system.

The system recommends lipstick shades based on the user's skin tone and undertone. This UI focuses on helping users confidently confirm and purchase the recommended product.

## 🎓 Inspiration

This design was inspired by a lipstick recommendation web application I developed during college as part of my academic project.

In that system:
- Users select their skin tone and undertone.
- The system recommends suitable lipstick shades.
- The user can then proceed to purchase the recommended shade.

This UI represents the final purchase step of that system.
